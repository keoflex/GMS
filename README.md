# GMS
GSuite Management System

This product is functioning in BETA.  

I will continue working on the project, by adding more features over time.  I however will not be implementing features by request.  If you would like a feature added to the system, feel free to contract Richard at rhconsultingllc.com.  They have done a great job helping me with this project and understand it as well, if not better than, me.


If you would like to donate to the project I will use it to further development for items under the Project section of this page.

GSuite Management System, for allowing District admins to better manage GAFE

# Service Account Setup

I am working on this.  Here are a few links if it helps and I will build documentation soon.
You will need a service account in the Google API for this program to work

https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/
https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis

Once you build your service account you will need to download the .p12 file and upload that to GMS -- again more documentation coming on that
