# GMS
GSuite Management System

This product is functioning in BETA.  

I will continue working on the project, by adding more features over time.  I however will not be implementing features by request.  If you would like a feature added to the system, feel free to contract Richard at rhconsultingllc.com.  They have done a great job helping me with this project and understand it as well, if not better than, me.


If you would like to donate to the project I will use it to further development for items under the Project section of this page.
